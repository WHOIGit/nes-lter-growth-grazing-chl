Phytoplankton growth and microzooplankton grazing rates were measured from incubation experiments using the dilution method in the framework of the Northeast U.S. Shelf Long-Term Ecological Research project. The data set includes plankton population dynamics rates obtained during 12 cruises from winter 2018 (EN608) to summer 2022 (EN687) along a north/south transect from Martha’s Vineyard to the shelf-break. Phytoplankton growth and microzooplankton grazing rates were measured for the total phytoplankton community (chl-a concentrations) and for size fractions (chl-a size fractionation) less than and greater than 10 µm. Phytoplankton growth and microzooplankton grazing rates, the first trophic interaction between primary producers and higher trophic levels, are essential parameters to assess the cycling and export of carbon in the ocean and to better understand marine food webs.
