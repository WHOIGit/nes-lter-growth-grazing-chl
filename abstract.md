Phytoplankton growth and microzooplankton grazing rates were measured from incubation experiments using the dilution method in the framework of the Northeast U.S. Shelf Long-Term Ecological Research project. The dataset gathers plankton population dynamics rates obtained during 11 cruises onboard the R/V Endeavor from winter 2018 (EN608) to spring 2022 (AR66) along a north/south transect from Martha’s Vineyard to the shelf-break. Phytoplankton growth and microzooplankton grazing rates were measured for the total phytoplankton community (chl-a concentrations) and for size fractions (chl-a size fractionation) less than and greater than 10 µm. Phytoplankton growth and microzooplankton grazing rates, the first trophic interaction between primary producers and higher trophic levels, are essential parameters to assess the cycling and export of carbon in the ocean and to better understand marine food webs.
