attribute	code	Definition
mu_N_mv	n/n	Not nutrient limited, thus no value.
mu_N_Std_mv	n/n	Not nutrient limited, thus no value.
grazing_mv	n/d	Not determined because g < 0, which is a violation of dilution method's assumption. 
grazing_Std_mv	n/d	Not determined because g < 0, which is a violation of dilution method's assumption. 
mu_10d_mv	n/c	Not calculated because Chl-a concentrations < 10 µm inferred from Chl-a total and Chl-a > 10 µm were too variable.
mu_10d_mv	n/a	Not available because no Chl-a size fractionnation was performed.
mu_10d_Std_mv	n/c	Not calculated because Chl-a concentrations < 10 µm inferred from Chl-a total and Chl-a > 10 µm were too variable.
mu_10d_Std_mv	n/a	Not available because no Chl-a size fractionnation was performed.
grazing_10d_mv	n/d	Not determined because g < 0, which is a violation of dilution method's assumption. 
grazing_10d_mv	n/a	Not available because no Chl-a size fractionnation was performed.

grazing_10d_Std_mv	n/a	Not available because no Chl-a size fractionnation was performed.
grazing_10d_Std_mv	n/c	Not calculated because Chl-a concentrations < 10 µm inferred from Chl-a total and Chl-a > 10 µm were too variable.
mu_10u_mv	n/a	Not available because no Chl-a size fractionnation was performed.
mu_10u_Std_mv	n/a	Not available because no Chl-a size fractionnation was performed.
