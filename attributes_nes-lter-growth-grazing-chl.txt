station	Station name used in the framework of the NES-LTER project	character				
cast	CTD cast number. Sometimes seawater was sampled during multiple cast. In this case, cast numbers are seprated by "|"	character				
bottle	Niskin bottle number on the CTD rosette used to sample seawater. Most of the time multiple bottles were used to sample seawater. In this case, cast numbers are separated by "-".

temp_light_inc_filename	Name of the .csv file of temperature and light intensity recorded during the incubation experiments with time steps of 5min. Temperature and light intensities recorded inside and outside of the incubation are reported. Temperatures are in oC and light intensities in Lux. Note that Lux is not a SI base unit. The light intensity measured by the HOBO light sensors are just qualitative, they cannot be used quantitatively. For quantitative light intensity measurements refer to PAR data recorded by the ship.	character
