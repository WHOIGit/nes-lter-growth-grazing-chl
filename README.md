## Creating a Data Package for NES-LTER Transect Cruise Plankton Growth and Grazing Data

This repository displays the workflow used to process the NES-LTER Transect cruise phytoplankton growth and microzooplankton grazing data in preparation for publication to the Environmental Data Initiative repository. Collection of these data is ongoing, so repeated updates of this package are expected.

This workflow includes the following:
1) imports the provided data
2) performs quality assurance on the data
3) assembles and outputs the final XML file for submission to EDI

**Base Requirements:**
- Microsoft Excel
- R and R studio (*packages:* tidyverse, readxl, lubridate, devtools, EMLassemblyline, EML, maps, xml2)

### Collaborators:
Pierre Marrec (postdoctoral associate), Susanne Menden-Deuer (principal investigator), NES-LTER Information Management team
