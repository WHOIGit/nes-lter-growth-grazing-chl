Phytoplankton growth and microzooplankton grazing rates were measured from incubation experiments using the dilution method in the framework of the Northeast US Shelf Long-Term Ecological Research project. The dataset gathers plankton population dynamics rates obtained during cruises onboard the R/V Endeavor in winter 2018 (EN608), summer 2018 (EN617), and winter 2019 (EN627) along a North/South transect from Martha’s Vineyard to the shelf-break. This is an ongoing dataset reporting the first phytoplankton growth and microzooplankton rates used for a publication. The dataset includes only rates obtained from surface samples. Different light treatments were used to simulate different environmental conditions and to better understand the role of light on plankton population dynamics. Phytoplankton growth and microzooplankton grazing rates were measured for the total phytoplankton community (Chl-a concentrations) and for size fractions (Chl-a size fractionation) less than and greater than 10 µm. Phytoplankton growth and microzooplankton grazing rates, the first trophic interaction between primary producers and higher trophic levels, are essential parameters to assess the cycling and export of carbon in the ocean and to better understand marine food webs.
